## 🧠 How the Resume Scoring Works

1. PDF resumes are parsed using `pdfjs-dist`
2. Job description and resume text are embedded using `Xenova MiniLM`
3. Cosine similarity is calculated to determine match score
4. Scores are stored in MongoDB (`atsReview` model)

* Admin dashboard with filters and search
* Resume highlighting with skill gaps
* Email alerts for interview shortlist
* Integration with LinkedIn / Naukri APIs
